\subsection{Linear regression revisited}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}

In order to motivate the Gaussian process viewpoint, let us return to the linear regression example and re-derive the predictive distribution by working in terms of distributions over functions $y(x,\mathbf{w})$. This will provide a specific example of a Gaussian process. Consider a model defined in terms of a linear combination of M fixed basis functions given by the elements of the vector (x) so that 

where x is the input vector andw is theM-dimensional weight vector.
