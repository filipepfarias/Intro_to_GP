\begin{frame}{Preamble} 
 The \textbf{Gaussian Processes} are the widely used stochastic processes for modeling dependent data observed over time, space or even tima and space. Here, we'll iniciate our study with a \textbf{Probability and Random Process Theory Review} taking some point to base our journey, going through \textbf{Linear Regression} and finally the \textbf{Gaussian Processes}. \par
 
The material here presented isn't sufficient to guide you over basic probability, so it's recommended to have some knowledge, once we'll just take a simple review.
